We describe here where to find the programs, what they do, and how to generate the figures in the paper.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you copy the entire repository on a local folder, you should be able to execute the programs straight away as indicated below on a Linux machine. On Windows, there might be problems because of a different syntax for the file structure and the necessary data and programs in the program headers might have to be imported manually.
IMPORTANT NOTE 2: The file ~/Data/PeanutEigenfunctions400.mat_temp needs its ending to be changed to .mat

How to generate the figures from the paper:

- Figure 1
    The plots are generated with the programs ~/Peanut Base tests/Needed Boundary Elements/plotnecessaryboundaryelements.m and ~/Peanut Base tests/Needed Boundary Elements/plotnecessaryboundaryelementswithinterpolation.m, called with
    plotnecessaryboundaryelements(2e-4,5e-6), plotnecessaryboundaryelementswithinterpolation(2e-4,5e-6),
    plotnecessaryboundaryelements(1e-4,5e-6), plotnecessaryboundaryelementswithinterpolation(1e-4,5e-6),
    plotnecessaryboundaryelements(2e-4,2e-6), plotnecessaryboundaryelementswithinterpolation(2e-4,2e-6).
- Figure 2
    The top two plots are plots of eigenfunctions number 1 and 56, they can be found in ~/Peanut Base functions.
    The other plots can be reproduced by running the script ~/Peanut Base tests/Comparison Reference Functions/plotcomparison.m
    The data in the folder had been previously generated by running 
    dirichletdeformedpeanutconvergencelist(1), dirichletdeformedpeanutconvergencelistdeluxe(1),
    dirichletdeformedpeanutconvergencelist(56), dirichletdeformedpeanutconvergencelistdeluxe(56)
- Figure 3
    The convergence test plots can be reproduced with the programs ~/Strong error tests/Peanut convergence tests/M/SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceMexact.m, ~/Strong error tests/Peanut convergence tests/N/SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceNexact.m and  ~/Strong error tests/Peanut convergence tests/N/Reference/SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceNreference.m and they are called with:
    SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceMexact(400,0.1,100,1,100),
    SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceNexact(400,0.1,100,1,100),
    SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceNexact(400,0.1,10,1,10).
    the last program takes a long time; the workload can be split in blocks from i to j ranging from 1 to 10 as
    SPDEsolvePeanutConvergenceNexact(400,0.1,10,i,j) (meaning that we generate 10 samples in total and work on sample i to j)
- Figure 4
    The programs to generate the four plots are in ~/Single peak.
    First, the solutions of the SPDEs are generated by calling the script createpeaks.m. Then, the script plotallscript.m is executed to generate the plots.

For preprocessing and generating an orthonormal basis, the program ~/Peanut Base tests/Base Generation/dirichletpeanutlist.m was used. It is called with dirichletpeanutlist(i) to compute the kth eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the Peanut shape (for 1<=i<=400). The number of boundary elements depends on the wavenumber and has been selected in accordance with the results shown in ~/Peanut Base tests/Needed Boundary Elements for the error tolerances 2e-5, 5e-6 (for wavenumbers and eigenfunctions respectively).
